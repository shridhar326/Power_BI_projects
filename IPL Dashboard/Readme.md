# IPL Dashboard
As IPL is in everyone's watch list. Everyone are curious to know about different stats that have taken place in their favourite game in that particular season. So with the help of visualisation it has been simplified. 

I have created a IPL Dashboard for the year 2022 with the help of PowerBI visualization tool and this IPL dashboard visualizes the details of highest wicket taker, highest run scorer, sum of dot balls, sum of maidan overs, sum of sixes, sum of fours. The dashboard is available in pdf format [IPL final dashboard.pdf](https://github.com/shridhar326/Power_BI_projects/blob/main/IPL%20Dashboard/IPL%20final%20dashboard.pdf) and also the dashboard can be downloaded here [IPL final dashboard](https://github.com/shridhar326/Power_BI_projects/blob/main/IPL%20Dashboard/IPL%20final%20dashboard.pbix) in pbix format
