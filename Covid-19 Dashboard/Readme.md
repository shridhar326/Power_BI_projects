# Covid-19 Dashboard

As people went through one of the worst times in this century due to COVID-19 virus. They were all locked up in their homes, so it was important to reach them through a very detailed overview of COVID cases in a creative way.

I have created a COVID-19 Dashboard by taking the data from http://www.trackcorona.com with the help of PowerBI visualization tool and this COVID-19 dashboard visualizes the details of confirmed cases, recovered cases, total number of deaths, total number of active cases, recovery rate, fatality rate with option to search for different countries. The dashboard is available in pdf format [covid dashboard](https://github.com/shridhar326/Power_BI_projects/blob/main/Covid-19%20Dashboard/covid%20dashboard.pdf) and also the dashboard can be downloaded here [COVID-19 Data Analysis](https://github.com/shridhar326/Power_BI_projects/blob/main/Covid-19%20Dashboard/Covid19DataAnalysis.pbix) in pbix format
